You may have seen toast notifications on many websites or web applications, as they are common features used to provide feedback or alerts to the user’s current task without interrupting it. If you’re interested in learning how to create a similar toast notification of your own, this blog is written for you.

In this blog, I’ll show you how to Create A Toast Notification in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with four styles: success, error, warning, and information. You can easily customize its design and behavior, and add it to your web application.

In this toast notification, there are four buttons on the webpage, and when a user clicks on one of them (e.g., “success,” “error,” or “info”), the relevant toast notification will pop up from the top right corner.

The toast will automatically disappear after five seconds, or the user can hide it by clicking on the close icon. To make the toast more visually appealing, I’ve added a progress line at the bottom of each toast.

For a video tutorial on how to create the toast notification using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can watch the given YouTube video.
